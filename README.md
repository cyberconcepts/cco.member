# Introduction

This is the first one of a series of Python packages for
the Zope-based knowledge management platform 
[loops](http://www.wissen-statt-suchen.de).

It will contain functionalities for registration and 
authentication of members of a loops site. 

There will be new modules as well as modules migrated from 
the current loops and cybertools repositories.

In order to use this stuff you need [BlueBream](http://bluebream.zope.org/)
and a running loops site. For more information see the 
[loops info site](http://www.wissen-statt-suchen.de/.1944518342).

More to come...
